# Day-One-2-Alfred-Workflow
Create Day One 2 entries directly from Alfred.

This is my personal Alfred workflow to create entries in Day One 2. This extension allows to create entries, in the default journal or a specified one, and making them starred using Alfred. It's also possible to create entries with multiple lines by using "/n".

__Usage__


New entry to the default journal: d1 (TEXT)

New starred entry to the default journal: d1s (TEXT)

New entry to the especified journal: d1j "(JOURNAL NAME)" (TEXT)

New starred entry to the especified journal: d1sj "(JOURNAL NAME)" (TEXT)


(The double quotes between the journal's name when specifing a journal to post in are required).
